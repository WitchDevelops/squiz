  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Company A",
    "country": "USA",
    "industry": "Technology",
    "numberOfEmployees": 1000
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Company B",
    "country": "Germany",
    "industry": "Finance",
    "numberOfEmployees": 500
  }
]
```

# Filtering & Sorting Logic

## Filtering

- Users can select one or more countries and industries.
- The list updates dynamically based on the selected filters.
- Filtering does not reset the sorting selection.

## Sorting

- Users can sort by name (A-Z, Z-A) or numberOfEmployees (ascending, descending).
- Sorting persists when filters are changed.
